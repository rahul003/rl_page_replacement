The code for pralgos started out as a version of this https://github.com/bighuggies/pagingalgorithms/blob/master/pager.py.
But it has since been modified quite a lot. Optimal policy rewritten, Master implemented. Other algos modified to support being used by Master.

SARSA and SGD have been implemented by me following Sutton and Barto's book.
Default parameter values have been taken from implementations of different RL algos and library codes available online.
